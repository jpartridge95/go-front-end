# Go App front end 


This is the front end for the Go app v1 repo on my github.


Currently I have just a react router setup, and will build the components
in this order:

# Project Log:


22/04/21 - Front end start, react router set. App beginning to feel real.

25/04/21 - Project Structure organized, just spent 1 hour fighting with what I can only assume is
the event loop working in tandem with react to make my life harder.
