# Go App front end 

This is the front end for the Go app v1 repo on my github.

Currently I have just a react router setup, and will build the components
in this order: 
        Home -> Reviews -> Accounts -> Bug Reporting

# ToDo
[] Complete Home Page
[] Complete ReviewsFeed Page
[] Complete Accounts Page
[] Bug Reporting

# Project Log:
22/04/21 - Front end start, react router set. App beginning to feel real.
