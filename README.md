# Go App front end 


This is the front end for the Go app v1 repo on my github.


Read the project log for info as to how the project is progressing, I am handling logic before I get to 
designing and styling. the logic side of things is expected to last roughly one more month (est. completion
30/05/21) as my cover teaching job is having to take precedence.

# Project Log:


22/04/21 - Front end start, react router set. App beginning to feel real.

25/04/21 - Project Structure organized, just spent 1 hour fighting with what I can only assume is
the event loop working in tandem with react to make my life harder.

29/04/21 - No users system implemented as of yet, but the core logic of the create review / view
full review is done. Next ToDo implement business logic for a create profile/account page.
